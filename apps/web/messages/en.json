Before a change is made, we recommend having a clarifying discussion with the current tax advisor, where any discrepancies can be clarified and cooperation can be restored. If this is no longer possible, please note the following points:<ul><li>Check the contractual commitment: are notice periods to be observed? If you want to terminate, it is best to do so in writing and observe the contractual deadlines.</li><li>New tax advisor: does the new tax advisor have the necessary industry-specific knowledge? In a personal discussion, you can assess whether there is a good \"chemistry\" and whether the new tax advisor understands your needs.</li><li>Power of attorney: once you have chosen a new tax advisor, you must grant them power of attorney for representation before the tax office and other relevant authorities. Inform the current tax advisor about the termination of the mandate and power of attorney.</li><li>Exchange of information: collect all relevant documents from the previous tax advisor and submit them to the new tax advisor. The new tax advisor should inform you about the relevant documents.</li><li>Transfer and transmission of data: ideally, data can be exported from the system of the previous tax advisor and imported into the system of the new tax advisor.</li></ul>"
